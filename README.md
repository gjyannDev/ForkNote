# ForkNote

ForkNote is a full-featured web application that lets users search for a wide variety of recipes using keywords or ingredients. Beyond just discovery, it also empowers users to create and save their own custom recipes—complete with ingredients, instructions, and personal notes—making it a versatile tool for both casual cooks and culinary enthusiasts looking to manage and personalize their cooking experience.

The application allows users to:

* Create and customize personal recipes, including ingredients and instructions.
* Save and organize searched recipes for easy access later.
* Search for recipes based on keywords, ingredients, or meal types.




## Features

* Easily find recipes using keywords or ingredients with a fast and intuitive search experience.
* Users can add their own recipes by specifying ingredients, instructions, and notes—ideal for documenting personal or family dishes.
* Save recipes from search results or custom entries to a personal collection for quick access later.
* Remove any recipe, whether custom-created or previously saved from search results, with a single click.
* All saved and custom recipes are stored in a database, ensuring they remain accessible even after a page refresh.



## Learnings
* __Firebase__: Learned how to integrate Firebase with Firestore to store and manage data in the cloud database effectively.
* __API__: Gained a solid understanding of key API concepts and successfully applied them in the project.
* __MealDB__: Utilized this public API to fetch recipe data and implemented various endpoints to enhance the app’s functionality.
* __DOM__: After completing this project, I now have a much clearer understanding of how the Document Object Model (DOM) works and how to manipulate it efficiently.

## Challenges Faced

* One major challenge was handling dynamic HTML updates, which often caused errors due to DOM elements not being available when accessed—resulting in null references and broken interactions. This helped reinforce the importance of timing and structure in DOM manipulation.
* Another key challenge was poorly structured reusable components. Their inflexibility and lack of abstraction led to bugs and slowed down development, highlighting the need for more thoughtful component design.

## Future Plans
* I’m interested in learning web scraping to collect recipe data from the web, especially since most recipe APIs are either paid or come with limited usage.
* When time permits, I plan to rebuild this application using the MERN stack and add more personalized features to better suit my own workflow and preferences.
